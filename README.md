## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A browser like Chrome or Firefox
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/tprussell19/SweetAndSavory.Solution`
2. Navigate to the `SweetAndSavory.Solution/` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. Create a database using SQL via Entity:
   - Navigate to `SweetAndSavory.Solution/SweetAndSavory` in your command line
   - Create a file named `appsettings.json` and paste the following code:
     ```
     {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=thomas_russell;uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-GOES-HERE];"
        }
     }
     ```
     Note: Be sure to change `[YOUR-PASSWORD-GOES-HERE]` to your actual MySQL password.
   - Run the command `dotnet ef migrations add Initial`. (If this command throws and error, you might have to run the command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` first.)
   - Once the migration has been added, run the command `dotnet ef database update` to setup your database.
5. To run the app:
   - Navigate to `SweetAndSavory.Solution/SweetAndSavory` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in the .csproj
   - Run the commmand `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the app and launch
   - If the application does not automatically launch in your browser, you will need to open a browser window and navigate to "localhost:5000"
